# Breast Cancer Analysis

We used machine learning algorithms to build a classification model which learn patterns of carcinogenic individuals and predicts if a new individual has or no cancer. The analyzed dataset contains about 2000 lines with 6 different features extracted from breast image exams and the target which indicates if the individual was diagnosed with cancer or not. This project was developed in Python using Keras, Pandas and scikit-learn libraries.

# Running

Follow the steps:

	$ conda env create -f environment.yml
	$ activate breast_cancer_analysis
	$ python main.py

# Features
* Neural network implementation using Keras 
* Many different sampling functions (uniform sampling, SMOTE sampling, and Random Sampling)
* Uses different metrics to evaluate the results

# Results

### Neural Networks ###

We tested several different architectures, those which presented the bests results were chosen trying to get better results after different improvements.
